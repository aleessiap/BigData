Angelica has been called away from her job to care for her father, who is recovering from a heart attack.\nThe reader should understand she consults and listens to her alter-ego, Blue Lady, in her thoughts.

I don't get it, until I learn Angelica has been dreaming, when I am told that she has awakened. The author, Stephany Tullis, has undertaken an interesting, but difficult, writing style, deeply developing a character by letting us move from dreams to reality and from thoughts to actions.

Her novels are all well written, but this one just seemed to flow so nicely, and I loved, loved the quotes (some well known and others not so much) she used as chapter headings. Langston Hughes was one of my childhood favorites, so seeing his quote solidified my reading connection with Tullis.\n\nNot to worry if you did not read the first book (but you should as it will make you smile throughout), because a brief intro catches up readers to a point this second makes sense and flows smoothly.\n\nAs a current caretaker of my handicap granddaughter, I quickly attached to Angelica, knowing the emotional and physical toll this takes on us, but seeing it as a heavy load we simply carry.  Not everyone can handle it.  Parents, Marshall and Marilyn were complete opposites in outlook almost balanced Angelica's plight.  Thank goodness her father, Marshall was a shiny beacon in this familial storm.\n\nSweet Dreams has its fair share of twists and turns, introducing various characters that are well depicted by author Tullis.\nOverall all, the deeply felt, thoughtfully drawn characters walked me though this philosophical story of enduring familial love with a smile on my face.  Yes, it is emotional, and yes we witness the hardships that often accompany bonds of family, but it teaches this may be a sacrifice, however in the end - is it really?

Nathan's father is homophobic, he hated that his son had shown interest in Jackson years before at college, so set Jackson up. Having lost what little he had at the time including his best friend and only love, Jackson has spent years since hating Nathan and his father. Now the business he has struggled to build is under threat, again it is the Steele family trying to take it from him. These two guys were falling in love before, now Nathan wants nothing more than to put things right but his father is still the same.\nThere is a murder amongst the turmoil and other events that happen in this story, there is a lot of sex as the guys despite everything are still attracted to each other and start to build some trust and develop their love. This is an M/M story so be aware if you don't like that subject matter, it is full on. I personally found it interesting both in how they work as a couple and the over all story, in fact I got quite warm at times. The plot as a whole contained some intrigue and mystery, it was fast paced with several things going on to keep you hooked. I found both main characters to be likeable, hot and very alpha. I loved that they were both trying to help each other, to understand and work at the relationship this time, that Nathan stood his ground.

One thing that really bugged me, though, was Jax's attitude towards Nathan coming back into his life. I do understand his anger about the past and holding a grudge for years (trust me) but it was annoying how one minute he'd be willing to try to get past it but as soon as anything came up he was right back to being angry and mistrusting. He was flip-flopping back & forth so much that I was considering taking back liking him as a character. He was like a tantrum throwing toddler at times, it became a bit much. I also thought that for him hating Nathan so much, he sure did have a lot of sex with him, and that was before things changed between them. And the part in the synopsis about Jax being the only one Nathan could turn to was kind of untrue, because while they were actually both helping and protecting each other, it was mostly Nathan protecting Jax.\n\nOverall, I liked the story. I liked that both of the men remained \"manly\" and didn't suddenly switch to overly flowery, feminine behavior and speech as can sometimes happen. The writing was pretty good and there were no editing mistakes at all that I could see. I especially liked that I wasn't able to immediately figure out the mystery or who the bad guy was.

Or, it is just me trying to find more sense if I can identify a book by genre.\n\nBut even if The Ravens Trail (book one) has bits of all of the above colorations I will still put it into love story category.

Marx received her degree in Performing Arts and her first foray in writing was creating children's plays, adapting Shakespeare for modern audiences, and translating the works of other international authors. Now she has settled in writing her own novels  first using the pen name Ella J Phoenix  to pen novels in her favored paranormal genre. She published five books in the Dragon Heat Series  stating on her website `Balancing life between working at a demanding full time job, living with a loving husband and feeding my obsession for paranormal novels is not easy.' Now using a new nom de plume - Liz D. Marx - she turns to romance novels passionate tales of love, filled with tense action, a touch of mystery and lots of magic, of course. She lives and creates in Sydney, Australia.\n\nLike many authors of the paranormal type Ella created many very strange names that match the creatures she created. As Liz she does the same, but unlike most authors, Liz generously offers a glossary before the novel begins to give definitions of the ideas, the mythology, and names of certain characters and groups and in doing so she lets her reader know that she is escorting them into a new sphere.\n\nLiz maintains her gift for building tension and romance simultaneously and places her story in a tribal situation not too distant from her practiced paranormal stories. At first the names require adjustment, but once the glossary is referenced for the first chapter the names fell and seem incidental, the story itself rises out of the strange setting into the realm of simply fine romance - and the setting becomes present day Washington, DC.\n\nLiz offers a synopsis to assist this new venture: Since she was a child, Chloe Doyle has had vivid dreams about a Native American prince living in a time long forgotten. When she finds a stone that matches the one in her dreams, she accidentally unlocks immense powers she cant control. Fueled by memories of someone elses past, she sets off on a wild quest for the stones birthplace, hoping to find answers to her foreboding dreams. But she ends up finding much more than that, in the form of a man who will test every ounce of her patience. On the outside, Mason Green seems like a hard-hearted, no-nonsense type of guy, with too busy a life for romance. Very few people know the real reason for his self-imposed seclusion. Its safer that way. But when Miss Chloe Doyle barges in, hes forced to get out of hiding and face the ghosts of his past.\n\nThis is Book 1 in this new direction for Liz and marks a very smooth transition into a new genre. The writing remains high quality and the ideas are fresh and offer a sense of historic spirit life of Native Americans. A wise decision for an author highly regarded for her skill at writing paranormal works. Watch her grow into a new dimension. Grady Harp, July 16", "summary": "He forbade me, Kaye.

Though when he became captain, he was still a decent guy. He earned the respect of his crew and fell in love with an Indian. I like how this author makes Peter Pan out to be the villain. I don't know if any of you watch the show Once Upon A Time, but there version of Neverland, Peter Pan also wasn't such a good guy and Hook (known as Killian on the show) is a very likable character.

Each book started so slowly that I almost put the series in my DNF category -- I kept nodding off.  I read another author in between reading this series, but finally picked these books up again and finished them.  If you can hang on past chapter 8 or 9 (in each book), then the story gets really good.  The books are well written, I just had to adjust to the pace and writing style of this author.  I got tired of the extreme descriptions of parlors and clothing.  There was some repetition, but I'm sure some parts were retold in case you hadn't read the previous book -- that's OK and makes each book standalone... but I was reading the series so I didn't need repetition.  I liked all the characters except Victoria the heroine.  She made bad choices that affected the men around her.  Another reviewer wrote: \"A complex tale. I liked the men but not Victoria.

Never Say Never focuses on Kelvin Jackson, another member of the secret government team we learned of in the first book and also Eva Pacheco the daughter of a leader of a cartel.\n\nWhile on a remote viewing assignment Kel sees Eva and believes that she is being held hostage and in danger. Insisting that he is the one that goes undercover on the assignment Kel gets in with the cartel but finds out who Eva really is, not only the daughter of the man Kel is assigned to take down but also a witch with the power to read thoughts. Kel still finds himself strangely drawn to Eva which puts himself and his assignment in danger.\n\nThis series is a mixture of a paranormal romance and a fast paced thrill ride. The characters have different abilities than the ones in the first book in the series but overall the story remains much the same with the secret team members needing to solve the case they are working on.\n\nI think this book was a bit more on the erotic side than the first in the story. Kel and Eva have a mental connection in the story and it seemed the fact they were reading each others attractions added to the steamier side of their relationship. But even with seeming to be more towards the relationship side this time there was still plenty of action in the story.\n\nOverall, this is turning into a pretty good series so far, fast paced and intense with a mix of abilities to the characters that is fun learning about.\n\nI received a copy from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "Never Say Never (The Nostradamus Prophecies, #2)", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

While it is part of a series, it is a stand alone novel. However, it is so good that you really owe to you yourself to read them all. The author is on my must read authors' list. This is a must read for fans of the genre.", "summary": "LOVED!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1468454400}
